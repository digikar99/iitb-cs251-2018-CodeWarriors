P1:

  If printing of error is not expected, parser.error() may be used
  However, that also displays the filename;
  and no updates on moodle were found until 1900 of 13022018
  regarding the same.

  1 is not a prime. The range is inclusive of 1 and 1000.

P2:

  The strings are of length 4.

  The latest decision is the final:
  https://moodle.iitb.ac.in/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=91203
  So, if the number for ask_choice is out-of-range, user is asked
  to re-enter it.

  In 1-5000, 5000 is excluded.
  In 5000-7000, both are included.


P5:
  infinity_stones.json is assumed to be present in P5 directory
