P1:

  If printing of error is not expected, parser.error() may be used
  However, that also displays the filename;

  regarding the same.

  1 is not a prime. The range is inclusive of 1 and 1000.

P2:

  The strings are of length 4.

  The latest decision is the final:
  https://moodle.iitb.ac.in/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=91203
  So, if the number for ask_choice is out-of-range, user is asked
  to re-enter it.

  In 1-5000, 5000 is excluded.
  In 5000-7000, both are included.

P3:
  The format given in the input file info_day.csv is assumed to be the
  output format.

P5:
  infinity_stones.json is assumed to be present in P5 directory

P6:
  In transfer.txt a dictionary is created with random characters and
  numbers with given constraints.

  In teams.txt the function makeTeams() is called at the end of the
  program and it is assummed that the program takes input based on the
  moodle discussion
    https://moodle.iitb.ac.in/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=91198
  rather than using argument as given in the question.
