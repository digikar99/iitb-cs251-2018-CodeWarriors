in file execution it is assumed that only files should be written thus avoiding the target 'targets'. it also include a file named 'malloc' but it didnt after execution of the makefile , i.e, it exits while makefile runs. Also we have written all dependencies of 'malloc' since malloc didnt exist at the beginning and is deleted at the end
