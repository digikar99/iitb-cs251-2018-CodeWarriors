All of the projects have already been done before by some human. So, the only criteria for deciding which project to choose depends on the what extra do we want to learn; and long term perpectives.

We chose p3 because it:
- we want to learn more about file-systems and encryption
- we want to learn to set up servers and remote 
- optionally, allows us to learn about package management on linux (so does p2)
- can learn about all of webapp, android app, optionally, as well as unity/desktop app 

- seemingly maintainable in the long term (the basis for p3 and p4 can change)
- can integrate machine learning into it (similar to google forms: try typing the question 'Did you like this?' in Google Forms) (sure, p4 is primarily ML-based)
- (the latter; because we hypothesize that while working on the computer, users tend to ignore their smartphones; besides this also allows for tracking during tests) [note that this is also true with p1-3]
