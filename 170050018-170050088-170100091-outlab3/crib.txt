P1 (task 1 and 2) - 0/10 marks have been awarded for both - We had also submitted [a different] data.txt in a hurry;  we assumed you would overwrite it - if you didn't, some of us can even put *** in data.txt and read it directly!. 
The error might be because of the different data.txt in our directory. With the data.txt as given as example in the proble statement the code runs and works as expected. 

P4 - Task 3 - 5/10 marks - As stated here (https://moodle.iitb.ac.in/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=90030#p137050), we have assumed that both s1 and s2 will be in students.txt. For the test case "0 4 4 4" as given here(https://moodle.iitb.ac.in/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=93747#p144139) (4,4) is not in the students.txt (given in the problem statement); and therefore, is wrong/invalid.

P5 -  25/30 - We presume that the discrepancy in marks is due to the __truediv__ method. We may not be given marks because the final answer after division is a floating point number with high precision. As stated here, https://moodle.iitb.ac.in/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=93747#p144357, we should be given marks for division. 

Or please let us know why the marks have been cut.
